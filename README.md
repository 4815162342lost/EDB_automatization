# EDB_automatization

One more dead project...

**EDB** -- internal 'CMDB' for servers\devices which under our support.
Our managers have low-expirience in IT and they are strange humans, and decided add to CMDB many unnecessary and strange fields. For example, Linux Kernel's version.
And this project was created to automatize kernel's version filled in EDB-system.

But unfortunately i did not receive necessary support\motivation from management and this project is dead.
